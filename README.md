# Crop Yield Analysis
This dataset contains geospatial agricultural data collected during the planting of crops and then again during the harvesting of those planted crops. The planting data sample size is 6,314 and includes the latitude and longitude of where the crop was planted, the seed variety, seeding rate (seeds planted per acre), seed spacing (inches), and speed. The harvest data sample size is 16,626 and includes the latitude and longitude of where the crops were harvested and the harvest yield at that location.

The goal of the following analysis is to match the planting data to the harvest data according to proximity in order to determine the planting variables associated with each harvest yield location. The combined planting and harvest yield data will be used to determine what planting variables, if any, demonstrate correlation to the harvest yield.
